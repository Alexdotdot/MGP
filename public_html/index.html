            <p id="metaphor3">As her young brown head detached itself against the patch-work cushion that habitually framed his wife's gaunt countenance, Ethan had a momentary schock. It was almost as if the other face, the face of the superseded woman, had obliterated that of the intruder.</p>

            <p id="imagery2">The kitchen... looked cold and squalid in the rainy winter night.</p>
            <p id="imagery3">She sat opposite the window, and the pale light reflected from the banks of snow made her face look more than usually drawn and bloodless, sharpened the three parallel creases between ear and check.</p>
